1. Numeric Commands
===================

Commands for numbers.

1.1. Pushing Numbers
--------------------

Pushing numbers is as easy as typing the number itself! ::

    1234    Pushes 1, 2, 3, and 4 individually
    :144:   Pushes 144 as a single number

1.2. Basic Arithmetic
---------------------

Seriously is a postfix language, meaning that operators come after arguments. ::

    23+     This adds 3 to 2.
    79-     Subtracts 7 from 9.
    35*     Multiplies 5 by 3.
    83/     Float division. This divides 3 by 8 returning 0.375.
    37\     Integer division. This divides 7 by 3 returning 2.

1.3. Other Arithmetical Operators
---------------------------------

Other important operators in arithmetic include: ::

    45^     Exponentiation. This raises 5 to the power of 4, returning 15625.
    7:29:%  Modulo operator. This calculates 29 mod 7, returning 1.

1.4. Boolean Operators
----------------------
