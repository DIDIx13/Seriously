===================

Commands for numbers.

1.1. Pushing Numbers
--------------------

Pushing numbers is as easy as typing the number itself! ::

    1234   Pushes 1, 2, 3, and 4 individually
    :144:  Pushes 144 as a single number

1.2. Basic Arithmetic
---------------------

Seriously is a postfix language, meaning that operators come after arguments.

    23+    Push 2, push 3, add. This returns 5.
    94-    Push 9, push 7, subtract. This returns 2.
    3*5    Push 3, push 5, multiply. This returns 15.
    83/    Push 8, push 3, divides 3 by 8. This returns 0.375.
