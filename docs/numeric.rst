1. Numeric Commands
===================

Commands for numbers.

1.1. Pushing Numbers
--------------------

Pushing numbers is as easy as typing the number itself! ::

<<<<<<< HEAD
    1234    Pushes 1, 2, 3, and 4 individually.
    :144:   Pushes 144 as a single number.
    "40"÷   Converts a string or float to an integer, int(x).
    5ñ      Pushes a number x, then pops x and pushes -x.
    TBC

1.2. Basic Arithmetic
---------------------

Seriously is a postfix language, meaning that operators come after arguments. ::

    23+     This adds 3 to 2.
    79-     Subtracts 7 from 9.
    35*     Multiplies 5 by 3.
    83/     Float division. This divides 3 by 8 returning 0.375.
    37\     Integer division. This divides 7 by 3 returning 2.
    :-5:A   The absolute value of a number.
    TBC

1.3. Other Arithmetical Operators
---------------------------------

Other important operators in arithmetic include: ::

    7u      Increment once, or push a+1.
    9D      Decrement once, or push a-1.
    45^     Exponentiation. This raises 5 to the power of 4, returning 15625.
    7:29:%  Modulo operator. This calculates 29 mod 7, returning 1.
    TBC

1.4. Boolean Operators
----------------------

Here are the comparison operators. ::

    33=     Equality comparator
    43<     Less-than
    25>     Greater-than
    92ó     Less-than-or-equal
    58ò     Greater-than-or-equal
    0Y      Logical NOT
    TBC

Here are the bitwise operators. ::

    37&     Bitwise AND
    45|     Bitwise OR
    1~      Bitwise negate
    TBC

1.5. Commands for Complex Numbers
---------------------------------

::

    TBC

1.6. Trigonometric Functions
----------------------------

Here are the trigonometric functions. ::

    :30:ø   Converts to radians.
    Ë§      Converts to degrees.
    3S      Sine in radians.
    2C      Cosine in radians.
    4T      Tangent in radians.
    TBC

1.7. Randomization Functions
----------------------------

Here are some commands that return random numbers. ::

    :100::20:B  Pushes a random integer in the range [20, 100).
    G           Pushes a random float in the range [0, 1).
    TBC

1.8. Miscellaneous Numeric Operators
------------------------------------

Here are the rest of Seriously's numeric operators. ::

    7!      The factorial function.
    :13:F   Returns the a-th Fibonacci number.
    TBC

1.9. Important Constants
------------------------

Here are some important constants. ::

    Ë       pi
    Ì       e
    TBC
